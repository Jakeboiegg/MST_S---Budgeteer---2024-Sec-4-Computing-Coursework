Our main project is the document Coursework.py

Our app is a budget tracker, where users input the amount they wish to divide up.
Users can also input the percentage of money they wish to save, and the app will display the amount of money they have saved and remaining amount left they can spend
The app will also track users' expenditure, by letting them input what they have spent on.
If users have spent too much, the application can warn them by showing them a warning. 
Users can decide the percentage of budget left before the warning will happen.
If users spend too much money, there will also be an indicator, telling them how much debt they are in.
